This repository will be used as a resource to prepare for a data scientist interview as well as a general resource for myself to look back to. 


## What We Expect From You, I.e., Your Qualifications

    Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Information Science, Mathematics, Physics or related discipline and 7 - 10 years of experience in that field. Master’s degree with 6 – 9 years of experience.
 
 I have just completed my bachelors degree in **Applied Mathematics** along with a Computer Science minor. I have been programming for about 8 years now with my introductory programming expreiences coming from classes made available to me my sophomore year of high school. After my introduction to Computer Science through introductory and intermediate Computer Science classes my sophomore year, I then went on to take AP Computer Science my Junior year and lead the Computer Science club in building apps and Java projects my Senior year. 
 
 For my first year of college I attended SUNY Fredonia, where I planned to major in Computer Science on the advanced computing track. I was able to test out of the first two Computer Science classes while continuing to take them for experience handling common tasks in **C++**, as in high school I mainly programmed in Java. Due to my testing out and with the aid of the chair of the Computer Science department I was able to take Data Structures my first semested of my college experience, leading to me taking Analysis and Design of Algorithms my second semester and competing on a competitive programming team.
 
 Though I had gained valuable experience in Mathematics (Discrete Math for Computer Science I and II, Calculus I and II), I believed that another institutuion may provide more opportunites for available higher level courses in different fields that peaked my interests. Upon transferring to **SUNY Oswego** for my sophomore year of college, I was lucky enough to gain entrance in to the first course in a two course series in **Artificial Intelligene**, learning about state-space problem solvers, genetic algorithms and other early breakthroughs in AI as we were learning the langauge that most of these staples to the field were written in, **Common LISP**. I continued on to take the second course in this series, which again was very lucky as it only came around once every two years and it happened to fall after the period when I took the first course in the series. 
 
 At Oswego I had the chance to take many exciting Computer Science courses including Systems Programming in which I got more intimate with the shell (later having to create a Tiny Shell implementation), Natural Language processing in which I used **Python** and the **NLTK (Natural Language Tool Kit)** in order to implement theoretical language processing tasks that we were reviewing in class. Though Computer Science is what truly excites me, I knew after taking this second AI course (In which I implemented a **Feed Forward Neural Network** from scratch) that I needed a firmer Mathematical background. This lead me to change my major to Applied Mathematics, as the good thing to do is not always the easy thing.
 
 All in all I am very pleased with my formal education as well as the two **Summer Research Positions** that I was able to aquire along the way due to my academic performance and previous project successes.
    
    Proficiency in Python.
    Experience with machine learning and data modeling techniques such as decision trees, random forests, SVM, neural networks and incremental response.
    Experience with statistical tests and procedures such as ANOVA, Chi-squared, correlation, regression, and time series.
    Experience with survey sampling methodologies and data collection techniques.
    Ability to lead small-sized teams.
    Applicants selected will be subject to a government security investigation and must meet eligibility requirements for access to classified information. U.S. citizenship is required.
